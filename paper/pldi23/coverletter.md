- B3) Done
- B4) We considered how to reduce the number of occurrences of "k-F(CP)S-TR" in
    the paper. However, we found that it is difficult to remove or replace the
    term in the paper because our work is highly related to test requirements
    for graph coverage criteria. Thus, we decided to keep the term in the paper.
- C4) the paper renames and re-defines well-known concepts
  - full paths -> test paths (O)
  - covers -> visits (X)
    We define a concept called "cover" to focus on the last node in the path
    slightly different with "visit" in [4].
  - valid -> feasible (O)
  - the toured path end in p is necessary to define "cover"
- D2) Because of the page limitation of the conference, we decided to not
    include more illustrative figures and examples in the final version.
- D5) Because of the page limitation of the conference, we decided to not
    include more detailed evaluation in the final version.
