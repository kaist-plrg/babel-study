The \textit{conformance testing} of programming language implementations is
crucial to support correct and consistent execution environments.
Because manually maintaining conformance tests for real-world
programming languages is cumbersome and labor-intensive,
researchers have presented various ways to make conformance tests effective and efficient.
One such approach is to use graph coverage, one of the most widely-used coverage criteria,
to generate tests that reach different parts of a \textit{mechanized language specification}.
Since mechanized specifications use functions to describe
the semantics of language features, traditional graph coverage
criteria for software work as they are.
However, they may not produce high-quality conformance tests
because language implementations often have
specialized execution paths for different features,
even when their semantics descriptions use the same functions.
Traditional graph coverage may not distinguish test requirements of
such language features, which degrades the quality of conformance testing.
Similarly, it may not distinguish test requirements of different
parts of the same language feature when their semantics descriptions
use the same functions.

We present \textit{feature-sensitive (FS) coverage} as a novel coverage criterion
to generate high-quality conformance tests for language implementations. 
It is a general extension of graph coverage, refining
conventional test requirements using the innermost enclosing language features.
We also introduce \textit{feature-call-path-sensitive (FCPS) coverage},
a variant of FS coverage, and extend both coverage criteria using the $k$-limiting approach.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the new coverage criteria for language implementations,
we apply them to a mechanized specification of JavaScript.
We extend $\jest$, the state-of-the-art JavaScript conformance test synthesizer
using coverage-guided mutational fuzzing, with various FS and FCPS coverage criteria.
For the latest JavaScript language specification (ES13, 2022), our tool automatically
synthesizes \inred{95,000} conformance tests in \inred{50} hours with five coverage criteria.
We evaluated the conformance of eight mainstream JavaScript implementations
(four engines and four transpilers) with the synthesized conformance
tests and discovered bugs in all of them.
The tool detected \inred{115} distinct conformance bugs (\inred{40} in engines
and \inred{75} in transpilers), \inred{80} of which were confirmed by
the developers and \inred{40} of which were newly discovered bugs.
