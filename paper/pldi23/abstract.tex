\begin{abstract}
  JavaScript is one of the most popular interpreted programming languages used
  in diverse fields. To support consistent execution environments anywhere,
  JavaScript engines and transpilers must conform to the ECMAScript language
  specification called ECMA-262, maintained by a committee, TC39. Therefore,
  creating and maintaining a \textit{conformance test} suite that strictly
  conforms to the specification, covers diverse language semantics, and consists
  of a small number of test programs are essential. However, it is challenging
  to do it automatically because of the complex language semantics with a highly
  dynamic nature and the fast-evolving language specification. Prior work
  utilizes coverage-guided fuzzing with a traditional branch coverage in the
  language specification to synthesize conformance tests. However, it cannot
  discriminate test programs related to different language semantics whose
  definitions share the same algorithms in the specification. As a result, it
  lowers the quality of the fuzzing guidance and even removes meaningful test
  programs in the final suite.

  This paper presents a novel \textit{feature-sensitive coverage} as a general
  extension of any coverage metrics. It alleviates the problem by discriminating
  the covered elements with enclosing contexts that consist of 1)
  \textit{language features} and 2) \textit{intra-feature call graphs}. We
  applied feature-sensitive coverage to a state-of-the-art JavaScript
  conformance test synthesizer, $\jest$, for evaluation. It automatically
  synthesized \inred{5,000} conformance tests for the latest language
  specification, ES2022 (ES13), in \inred{100} hours. We tested six mainstream
  targets (four engines and four transpilers) with synthesized conformance tests
  and discovered bugs in all of them. We had reported \inred{30} unique
  conformance bugs (\inred{10} in engines and \inred{20} in transpilers),
  developers confirmed all of them, and \inred{15} were undiscovered bugs.
  \inred{In addition, the committee added 25 tests synthesized by our tool to
  Test262, the official JavaScript conformance test suite.}
