\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Conformance testing using graph coverage has been one of the most
promising approaches to support correct and consistent implementations
of programming language semantics.
However, because language implementations often utilize 
different execution paths even for the same functionalities,
traditional graph coverage does not produce high-quality conformance tests.
In this paper, we present novel coverage criteria especially designed
for language implementations: \textit{feature-sensitive (FS) coverage} and
\textit{feature-call-path-sensitive (FCPS) coverage}
by refining conventional test requirements using
enclosing language features and call paths.
Our experiments show that the new coverage criteria outperform the
traditional coverage criteria in the context of conformance bug detection in
real-world JavaScript implementations.
