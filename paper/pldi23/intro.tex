%- Javascript is evolving. There was the big change of ES5 to ES6, and new features are coming every year.
%
%- Unfortunately, there are different browsers and environments for JS, and not all of them supoort the newest features.
%
%- Therefore, the code is desugared. The recent features of javascript is expressed in terms of older features.
%  ex = babel

%- (Problem Statement)
%  + It is important to understand HOW the input and the output of the desugarer are different.
%    - make sure that the difference between the input code and the ouptut code of the desugarer is minimized, and there aren't any non-trivial semantic difference.
%    - clarify the conditions that the semantics may vary, and use carefully.
%- (Challanges: why is it hard?)
%  + (No definition of "differnce"?)
%  + Complex semantics
%  + Test can not cover every cases
%
%- (How did we solve it?)
%  + In this paper, we suggest the method to automatically extract the semantic difference between input and output of desugarer.
%  First, we express the desugarer in terms of finite pairs of "syntactic view (AAST?)".
%  Second, each syntactic view is evaluated with ES-Meta, and the summary is generated
%  Finally, the summaries are compared to see if there are any differneces, and if there is, the condition for realizing the difference is identified.
%
%- We tested wth babel. We introduce some known bugs of babel where the input and output show differecnt semantics, and showcase that our system can
%  detect the bugs. (In addition, we newly figured out unidentified bugs from babel and reported them)
%
%- Contibution
%  + Suggest method for quantifying the difference between a program and desugared program.
%  + Implement the system that can automatically compare the trace in given
%  + Find bug from babel by finding nontrivial difference



% Javascript is evolving, and new features are added to it every year.
% The official specification of javascript is defined by ECMA-262, the ECMAScript language speicification,
% and the new feaatures are added in the specification with each update.
% After the release of the 6th edition of ECMAScript specification (ES6) in 2015,
% the specification has been updated every year, introducing new featues with each update.
%
% Unfortunately, not every browsers and environments for Javascript supoort the newest features.
% (Insert some statistical data of feature support here)
% This is problematic for Javascript devleopers that want to use the newest features,
% and still want their code to run on every possible environment.
%
% Therefore, the Javascript developers desugar their Javascript code.
% Desugaring is the process of rewriting the recent features of javascript in terms of older features.
% The defacto standard for desugaring the code is using Babel.
% (Statistic about use of Babel in real world)
%
% In perspective of implementing the desugarer, it is important to understand how the input and the output of the desugarer behave differently.
% First, the primary goal of desugarer is to generate the ouptut code that behaves equivalently with the input code.
% Therefore, the developers would look at the difference between two codes, and try to minimize the difference.
% Second, there are some cases where the similar behavior is sacrificed as a trade-off between the performance or the size of the output code.
% In that case, the developer would want to clarify the conditions of the input program that will make the output program behaves differently
% and what are the specific behaviour difference that the output code has,
% so that the user of the desugar can be aware of it.
%
% However, figuring out the difference of two codes is not an easy task.
% One reason for the difficulty comes from the complex semantics of Javascript.
% One nortrious example of "wrong" desugar happens when the logical assignment operator, $\&\&=$ or $\vert\vert=$, is used.
% $x \&\&= y$ is an expression that assigns that value of y to x, only if x is truthy.
% One might be tempted to desugar the expression into $x = x \&\& y$, but it is wrong since the assigmnet always happen in this desugared code.
% The correct desugaring is to use $x \&\& x = y$. As illustrated, In order to detect such difference for desugarer of certain feature,
% the developer would have to fully understand the semantics of the target feature. Another challenge is that it is difficult to fully
% think of every possible inputs for desugarer, and it is easy to miss the edge cases.
% For example, there was an actual bug in babel for desugaring array destructuring. The bug happend when the input code was
% destructuring the empty string, like in $let [a] = ""$. In the desugared code, the value "" was assigned to an unintended
% variable due to the short-circuit behavior, which caused a runtime error.
%
% In this paper, we suggest the method to automatically extract the semantic difference between input and output of desugarer.
% First, we express the desugarer in terms of finite pairs of \textit{syntactic view}. Syntactic view is an AST where some nodes are
% substituted with "abstract node".
% Second, each syntactic view, the \textit{summary} is generated. The summary is defined as the list of
% operations that are performed to the abstract node in the given syntactic view during evaluation of syntactic view.
% The evaluation of syntactic view is implemented with ESMeta[..], a tool for extracting mechanized specification from ECMAScript specification.
% Finally, we compare the two summaries to see if there are any differneces,
% and if there are, we identify the condition that input program should satisfy in order for the different behavior to occur.
%
% In order to test the practicallity of our approach, we performed a case study with Babel.
% We introduce some known bugs of babel where the input and output show differecnt semantics,
% and showcase that our system can detect these bugs by detecting the non-trivial difference between summaries of input and output.
% (In addition, we newly found new bugs from babel and reported them)
%
% The contibutions of the paper are as followed.
%   + We suggest method for formally expressing the semantic difference between a program and desugared program.
%   + We implement the system that can automatically extract the
%   (+ We Find bug grom babel by finding nontrivial difference)
